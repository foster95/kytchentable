Kytchen Table: Come Home to the Table

Welcome to Kytchen Table, your newest farm to table restaurant, serving food from the heart, and sourced and supported by local famers and suppliers and run by Head Chef Kyran Becker. Kytchen Table's wesite is designed with users at its heart, allowing them to see the menu with ease, as well as signing up to the restaurant to allow them to make and amend bookings and join their mailing list to recieve up to date information about the restaurants seasonal menu changes. The website also has backend functionality, allowing Super Admins to add, modify and make changes to menu options on the live site, as well as control and amend bookings. 

The target audience for Kytchen Table is middle class and wealthy food lovers, who are keen on knowing the stories of their food and the journey the ingredients took to reach their plate. It is directly inspired by restaurants such as Simon Rogan's Henrock and Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quatâ€™Saisons.

Welcome to our table. Welcome home.

# UX
## Five Planes of UX Design
To build out Kytchen Table, I used the theory of the 5 planes of UX, going through them one by one to help flesh out the project needs and requirements. The theory of the 5 planes of UX design is the following: Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton and Surface.

## Strategy
### Purpose
* To provide the restaurant management team with a website that can monitor and manage restaurant reservations and menus
* To provide potential customers with a holistic and intuitve website which allows the user to find out about the website, including the menu available at the time of year, and make a reservation, as well as give them the tools to amend the booking if required.

### Primary User Needs
* Restaurant management need to be able to see an overview of the reservations by day
* Restaurant management need to be able to amend any booking via an admin system in case of last minute bookings/cancellations etc
* Restaurant management need to be able to amend the menu to update every season
* Users need to be able to create their own reservation and modify or cancel the reservation after the fact
* Guests, Users and Management need to be able to see the seasonal menu at the time, including allergens. 

### Business Goals
* To provide a website that provides an upscale, sleek experience, mirroring the experience they will be recieving at the restaurant.
* The website should include a management portal for restaurant managers to be able to add, remove or amend all menus, as well as update allergens. 
* The website mangement portal should also make life as easy for staff as possible, with an immediate overview as to not just bookings by day but the available tables by day and time slot as well
